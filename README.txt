Final Fantasy 6 Steam Resolution Fix by Ark.

This removes the games shimmering effect upon movement and forces a correct Pixel rendering 
by forcing correct resolutions relative to the games Tilespace and Tile Resolution resulting 
in improved Visuals.


Usage instructions:

1. Open FF6 Launcher and set the game to Windowed. Close/Save changes.
2. Locate your Settings File. (Located in Steamfolder\userdata\XXXX\382900\local)
3. Drag your settings.bin file onto the res.exe Corresponding to the Resolution You desire.
*Done*

Run The game Directly from FF6.exe!


*Notes*: 

 - You have to repeat this process everytime you use the launcher to change your Laguage or 
controller settings.
- To play in Fullscreen mode it is required to Force Borderless Windowed By using eternal tools
such as Borderless Gaming. (Included in Atma Weapon installer)
